# S2 Region Coverer Online Viewer

This is an online tool to view S2 Cell tokens. To learn more about S2 geometry, see: [s2geometry.io](https://s2geometry.io/). Also check [Useful S2 Geometry Links](https://docs.s2cell.aliddell.com/en/stable/useful_s2_links.html).

## Previous Work
There used to exist a very similar tool hosted at [s2.sidewalklabs.com/regioncoverer/](https://s2.sidewalklabs.com/regioncoverer/) but it is long gone now. I came across [Wasm with Go to build an S2 cover map viewer](https://blog.nobugware.com/post/2018/wasm_go_s2_javascript/) by Fabrice AkHeN which combines S2 Cell lib in Go and Wasm which can be seen at [s2.inair.space](https://s2.inair.space) and tweaked it a bit.
